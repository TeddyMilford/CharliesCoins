Teddy and Nicola phase 2 group project.

**Problem:**
- We want to see live trading data and follow stocks/coins/commodities that we're interested in tracking.

**User Stories**
- As a user, I can see live prices of stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities
- As a user, I can see detailed information about the company/factors impacting the stock/coin/commodity's price
- As a user, I can search from the listed stocks/coins/commodities, so that I don't have to scroll through a long list to find what I'm looking for
- As a user, I can filter the list of stocks and commodities to view my sector
- As a user, I can sort the list to view by highest price, lowest price, daily gains %, daily losses %
- As a user, I can set a list of stocks, cryptocurrenices, and commodities that I am watching, so that I can quickly find those that I'm interested in tracking
- As a user, I can see historical data for stocks that I'm tracking

**Phase 2 Project Guidelines**

**Learning Goals**
- Build a React single page application from scratch
- Apply your knowledge of components, props and state management
- Incorporate client-side routing
- Use data from an API

**Introduction**
Now that you've learned the fundamentals of React, it's time to practice and expand your skills by making a React project from scratch!

This assignment is open-ended when it comes to the actual content. You are free to create whatever you'd like, as long as it incorporates the requirements listed in these instructions.

**Requirements**
You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.
Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.
There should be at least 3 client-side routes using React Router. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled components or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like React Bootstrap, Semantic UI, or Material UI) if you prefer.
Stretch Goals
Once you have met the minimum requirements, feel free to explore! These are only the basic requirements â€” you're free to add on as much stuff as you'd like. For example, you may want to incorporate data from an external API.
