Teddy and Nicola phase 2 group project.

**Problem:**
- We want to see live trading data and follow stocks/coins/commodities that we're interested in tracking.

**User Stories**
- As a user, I can see live prices of stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities
- As a user, I can see detailed information about the company/factors impacting the stock/coin/commodity's price
- As a user, I can search from the listed stocks/coins/commodities, so that I don't have to scroll through a long list to find what I'm looking for
- As a user, I can filter the list of stocks and commodities to view my sector
- As a user, I can sort the list to view by highest price, lowest price, daily gains %, daily losses %
- As a user, I can set a list of stocks, cryptocurrenices, and commodities that I am watching, so that I can quickly find those that I'm interested in tracking
- As a user, I can see historical data for stocks that I'm tracking
